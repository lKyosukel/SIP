Solidity Code

How It Works

    Device Registration: The contract owner (administrator) registers a new IoT device by providing a unique device ID and its associated Ethereum address.
    Authorization: The contract owner can authorize or deauthorize devices.
    Heartbeat Mechanism: Authorized devices can send a heartbeat signal to the contract to indicate they are active and functioning.
    Check Authorization: Users can check if a device is authorized and get the timestamp of the last heartbeat.
